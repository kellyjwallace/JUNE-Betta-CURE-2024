#MY NAME:

#MY RESEARCH QUESTION:

#MY SAMPLE:

#MY INDEPENDENT VARIABLE (X AXIS):

#MY INDEPENDENT VARIABLE TYPE (categorical or continuous, if categorical are there more than two categories?):

#MY DEPENDENT VARIABLE (Y AXIS):

#MY DEPENDENT VARIABLE TYPE (categorical or continuous, if categorical are there more than two categories?): 

#MY PREDICTION:

#MY P VALUE (based on step 5 below):

##################################### Let's get started!

#Step 0: In files (on the right, by plots), click upload and upload the data mastersheet. 
#Click on the file name and select import
#In "name" write "df"

#Step 1: load relevant packages. These packages allow you do do specific functions, such as generate a graph
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

#Step 2: import and view the class-wide data file with the data you scored from your Behavior Day 2 videos
```{r}

View(df)

```


#Step 3: select only the specific *rows* you need for your question (aka which videos)
```{r}

mydf<-df %>% filter([COLUMN NAME] == "[CHARACTER]")

```

#Step 4: select only the specific *columns* you need for your question (aka which metrics)
```{r}

mydf<-mydf %>% select([COLLUMN A], [COLUMN B])


```

#Step 5: view your specific data to make sure it looks good
```{r}

View(mydf)


```

#Step 6: Plot your dependent variable for all fish to make sure it looks in the right range (this will make the most unnecessarily wide boxplot you've ever seen)
#BONUS: here's a great link to different color names: https://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour 
```{r}

ggplot(mydf, aes(x=1, y=[DEPENDENT VARIABLE])) + geom_boxplot(fill="cornflowerblue",) + geom_jitter(width = 0.01)+ theme_classic()

```


#Step 7a: If your independent variable is continuous, follow these steps below
```{r}

 mydf<-na.omit(mydf)
 mod <- lm(myd$[DEPENDENT VARIABLE] ~ mydf$[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE])
 p_value <- summary(mod)$coefficients[8]
 print(paste("[DEPENDENT VARIABLE] as a function of [INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], p value = ", round(p_value, 4)))

```

#Step 7b: If your independent variable is categorical with two categories, follow these steps below
```{r}

 mydf<-na.omit(mydf)
 mydf$[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE]<-as.factor(mydf$[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE])
 test<-t.test([DEPENDENT VARIABLE] ~ [INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], data = mydf)
 pval<-test$p.value
 print(paste("[DEPENDENT VARIABLE] as a function of [INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], p value= ", pval))

```

#Step 7c: If your independent variable is categorial with more than two categories, follow these steps below
```{r}

 mydf<-na.omit(mydf)
 mydf$[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE]<-as.factor(mydf$[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE]
 test<-aov([DEPENDENT VARIABLE] ~ [INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], data = mydf)
 summary(test)
 pval<-summary(test)[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][[1]]
 print(paste("[DEPENDENT VARIABLE] as a function of [INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], p value= ", pval))

```

#Step 8a: Plot your result (from 7a) 
```{r}
 ggplot(mydf, aes([INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], [DEPENDENT VARIABLE])) + 
     geom_point(size = 4, colour = "blue") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
     se = FALSE, colour = "gray60") + theme(text = element_text(size = 10)) + 
     labs(x = "[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE]", y = "[DEPENDENT VARIABLE]") + theme_classic()

```

#Step 8b: Plot your result (from 7b)
```{r}
ggplot(mydf, aes(x=[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], y=[DEPENDENT VARIABLE], fill= [INDEPENDENT VARIABLE])) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(size = 3)+ theme_classic() + scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "yellow"))

```

#Step 8c: Plot your result (from 7c)
```{r}
ggplot(mydf, aes(x=[INDEPENDENT VARIABLE], y=[DEPENDENT VARIABLE], fill= [INDEPENDENT VARIABLE])) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point(size = 3)+ theme_classic() + scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "orange", "yellow"))

```

#(Note: if you want to export your graph, copy the line into the console, and then the resulting graph will show up in the plots panel on the right!)


#Step 9: Repeat this again from step 3, now with the gill flaring information! I recommend you call the new dataset mydf2 or mydfgill or something like that so you don't accidentally overwrite your old information. You can insert new chunks here, or you can make just add code into one big chunk here.

#
#

#Step 10: When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
